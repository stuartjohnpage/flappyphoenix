# Flappy Phoenix

Welcome to **Flappy Phoenix**, a game built using Phoenix LiveView. In this game, you control a little phoenix bird (the same one from the Phoenix Framework logo) and your goal is to avoid other framework logos while keeping the bird within the screen bounds. The game gets progressively harder as you play, so stay sharp!

# Note: 

When I first started writing this, I had no idea https://github.com/moomerman/flappy-phoenix existed: a previous project which implements LiveView to create a faithful Flappy bird clone. You should check this project out if you are interested: it's pretty cool!
