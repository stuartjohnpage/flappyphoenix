# Flappy Phoenix

Welcome to **Flappy Phoenix**, a game built using Phoenix LiveView. In this game, you control a little phoenix bird (the same one from the Phoenix Framework logo) and your goal is to avoid other framework logos while keeping the bird within the screen bounds. The game gets progressively harder as you play, so stay sharp!

# Note: 

This project should not be confused with [Flappy Phoenix](https://github.com/moomerman/flappy-phoenix). When I first thought up the concept and title for this game, I had no idea that that project existed. It's a pretty old project that implements an early version LiveView to create a faithful Flappy bird clone. You should check it out if you are interested: it's pretty cool!

## Gameplay

- **Objective**: Avoid touching any of the framework logos that appear as enemies and keep the bird within the screen bounds.
- **Controls**: Use the arrow keys or WASD to move up, down, left, and right.
- **Score**: The score increases the longer you survive, and the more enemies you destroy.
- **Power-ups**: Collect special items to gain temporary advantages:
- `REACT-ive armour`: Temporary invincibility, which destroys enemies you come into contact with.
- `The ELIXIR of LASER`: Press the space bar to fire a laser which destroys all enemies in it's path.
- `THE OBANomb`: Destroys all enemies on the screen.
